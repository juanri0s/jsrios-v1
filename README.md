The first version of my personal website

## Design

This was my first crack at making a personal website from scratch. It wasn't much but it was a proud accomplishment of mine since I kept putting it off thinking I would not be able to do it. The design is very minimal and it really opened me up to finding out about color theory and typography. This website really got me going into learning more about web design. Overall the website did not have a lot of content and was more landing page based for anyone trying to find my contact information.
